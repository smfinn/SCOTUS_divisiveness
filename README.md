# SCOTUS_divisiveness
Examining divisiveness in the Supreme Court since 1970.

Final project for Categorical Data Analysis course at Loyola University Chicago. I used SCOTUS opinion data scraped by Kaggle user Garrett Fiddler to examine the question of whether the Supreme Court has become more divided since 1970. This analysis found inconclusive evidence, as different metrics of "divisiveness" pointed to different conclusions. I hope to return to this project at some point to incorporate Natural Language Processing techniques on the opinion texts.
